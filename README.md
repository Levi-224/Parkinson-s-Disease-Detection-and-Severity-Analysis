# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-and-Severity-Analysis
 This work focuses on the detection and prediction of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) severity using
 machine learning and deep learning techniques based on voice samples as data. The project
 used the MSR dataset with voice features from healthy controls and patients with PD, thus
 it applied statistical analysis to find the significant differences in vocal characteristics. Key
 features including jitter, shimmer, and harmonicity are extracted and analyzed in order to
 make the differentiation between healthy and affected individuals. Various machine learning
 models are implemented during the project: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), XGBoost,
 LightGBM, and Random Forest for classification of the presence of PD as well as UPDRS score
 prediction, the assessment of disease severity.
 In addition to classification, the project includes a holistic approach for predicting motor
 and total UPDRS scores based on a separate Telemonitoring dataset. Using advanced regres
sion techniques, the model is expected to provide accurate predictions of disease severity based
 on voice features. Real-world voice sample analysis through Praat software improves the fea
ture extraction process, providing a more detailed understanding of vocal changes associated
 with PD. Ultimately, this project contributes to early detection of Parkinson’s Disease while
 providing a framework for the evaluation of its progression, thus providing timely interventions
 that improve patient outcomes.
